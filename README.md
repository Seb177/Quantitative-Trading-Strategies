Miscellaneous files to demonstrate my work.

I am also running crypto market making bots.
The private repository houses my collection of advanced market making bots designed for efficient trading in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. The bots are equipped with powerful functionalities to optimize trading strategies and capitalize on profitable opportunities.

**Send Alerts**: The market making bots are programmed to send real-time notifications, keeping me updated on critical events, trading opportunities, and potential risks.

**Regular Check of Balances**: The bots perform routine balance checks across multiple exchanges, enabling efficient management of cryptocurrency holdings.

**Spread Deviation Monitoring**: By continuously analyzing market spreads, the bots provide insights into lucrative arbitrage opportunities between different cryptocurrency exchanges.

**Liquidations (Low Balance) Alerts**: The bots monitor account balances and promptly alert me in case of low balances or potential liquidation events.

**Funding Fee Check**: Stay informed about funding fee rates on derivative exchanges, ensuring cost optimization in trading.
